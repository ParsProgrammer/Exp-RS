The framework consists of a recommendation model and an explanation generation model, which are designed to provide the target user with explainable recommendations. The recommendation model utilizes ratings plus reviews to understand users' interests. Moreover, the explanation generation model uses user-generated reviews as a textual source to produce a couple of review-like sentences.
